Hi, welcome to Botmakers!

We are a diverse group of enthusiasts who make and share fun and creative online bots. Come introduce yourself in the <#C0ARTV6S2> channel :simple_smile:

Some useful channels are:

- <#C0AU5ATGQ>: get help and feedback
- <#C0E4VFBQ8>: post links to what you're working on
- <#C0B0T2BL4>: share useful tools and resources
- <#C0JJDUF44>: share your ideas and look for collaborators

There is usually no need to post the same message in multiple channels, and please avoid outright spam. This group is focused mainly on creative and open-source examples of bots, not really for "growth hacking".

You can respond to this message with `For admins:` to have it forwarded to the group's admins. To see what else I can do, type `/sidekick`.

Always feel free to speak up, and you can also leave us anonymous feedback through one of our surveys at botwiki.org/about/surveys. And remember that we have a <#C0CET7D37>: botwiki.org/coc

Please note that Botwiki and Botmakers are personal side projects and we appreciate any help: botwiki.org/about/support-us

Thank you :simple_smile:
