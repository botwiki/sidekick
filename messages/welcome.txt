Hi, welcome to Botmakers!

Come introduce yourself in the <#C0ARTV6S2> channel :simple_smile:

Some useful channels are:

- <#C0AU5ATGQ>: get help and feedback
- <#C0E4VFBQ8>: post links to what you're working on
- <#C0B0T2BL4>: share useful tools and resources
- <#C0JJDUF44>: share your ideas and look for collaborators

You can respond to this message with `For admins:` to have it forwarded to the group's admins. To see what else I can do, type `/sidekick`.

Be sure to check out the _Bot! zine_ newsletter (botzine.org), and follow twitter.com/botwikidotorg.

Always feel free to speak up, and you can also leave us anonymous feedback through one of our surveys at botwiki.org/about/surveys. And remember that we have a <#C0CET7D37>: botwiki.org/coc

Please note that Botwiki and Botmakers are personal side projects and we appreciate any help: botwiki.org/about/support 

Thank you :simple_smile:
